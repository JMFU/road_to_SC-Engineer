### Muchas gracias y a darle duro a aprender !!!!!


# 2.1 Conceptos Basicos

# 2.1.1 Blockchain
Un blockchain, o cadena pa' los cuates, es una manera digital que mediante cierta descentralización (esta parte es debatible ya que en general, la intención e tener un sistema descentralizado, pero existen bloques como Solana, que su beneficio es que es descentralizada solo para pocos nodos) permite almacenar información de manera que sea dificil y hasta imposible, cambiar, hackear, o engañar al sistema. Funciona como un libro mayor contable distribuido digitalmente, descentralizado y sobre todo público (igual, hasta cierto grado), que existe a través de una red de pares.

# 2.2.2 Criptoactivo
Un criptoactivo o, aca entre nos, un cripto, es una divisa digital, que por sus caracteristicas de creación, léase, empleando seguridad criptográfica, se puede emplear como medio de cambio. Emplea la seguridad criptográfica para autentificar transacciones públicas, así como para regular la generación de nuevas unidades de la divisa.

# 2.2.3
Dapp - decentralized application

A decentralized app (dApp) is a digital application or a program that resides and executes on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single computer and is independent of anyone's authority's control.

NFT - non-fungible token

NFTs are blockchain-based tokens that each represent a unique asset such as a work of art, digital property, or media. It can be anything from music to a website domain.

ICOs - initial coin offering

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a popular financing tool for firms that want to sell products and services in the cryptocurrency and blockchain arena.

Crypto Wallet

A crypto wallet is a program or software that allows users to engage and interact with blockchain networks directly. Some popular are Coin base, Meta mask, and Wallet connect.

Gas Fees

The transaction costs that users pay to miners on a blockchain protocol to get their transaction included in the block are referred to as "gas fees."

DeFi - Decentralized finance

DeFi is a term for peer-to-peer financial services on public blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana and etc.

Tokens

A crypto token is virtual money. It is a tradable asset or utility that exists on its own blockchain and can be used for investment. Tokens are typically used to describe all crypto assets.

Smart Contract

A smart contract is a decentralized program that responds to events by executing business logic.

HODL 

Hodl is a cryptocurrency technique in which traders are "hodling on for dear life," as the name implies. This means that a trader must refrain from selling the cryptocurrency token, even at periods when its value is extremely volatile.

BUIDL

In the same way that "HODL" is a warping of the word "build," BUIDL is a warping of the word "build." Instead of passively retaining, BUIDL is a call to arms for growing and contributing to the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Staking

DeFi staking frequently refers to locking up tokens within a protocol to achieve a certain aim or effect, rather than securing block creation.

Bridge 

A blockchain bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of tokens and/or arbitrary data from one chain to another.

DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization 

A DAO is a community-run organization with no central authority. It is completely self-contained and transparent: smart contracts establish the ground rules, carry out the agreed-upon decisions.

Wallet address 

Your wallet address is a unique string of numbers and letters (also called a public key) that people can use to send you cryptocurrency.

Airdrop

When a corporation distributes crypto or an NFT directly into your wallet, it is known as an airdrop. Instead of an initial public offering, blockchain services will issue a token and distribute it to people who have previously utilized the service.

Buy the dip

This is when you acquire more of an asset after its value has dropped. If the price of Ethereum falls by $2,000, for example, a Ethereum holder might "buy the dip."

To the moon

The term "mooning" or "moon" refers to a sharp price increase. The term "to the moon" is well-known.

Opensea 

It is the world's largest NFT exchange, specializing in ethereum-based NFTs.

Cross-chain & Multichain

Stablecoin

Cryptocurrencies that are tied to the US dollar are known as stablecoins. Tether and USDC are two examples.

Whitelist

A cryptocurrency and non-fungible token presale list. Whitelisted investors have the opportunity to purchase the item before it is released to the general public, often at a discount.
